**Salesforce Optimization & Advisory Services Website Image Style Guide**

**Core Aesthetic**

- **Theme:** Futuristic cyberpunk neon with Salesforce Agentforce-era vibes (2024–2025 marketing style).
- **Mood:** High-tech, professional yet sci-fi – holographic, glowing, quantum-inspired. Hyper-realistic but slightly surreal.
- **Background:** Dark (black or deep navy) with high-tech digital grid patterns, subtle circuit boards, or infinite depth.
- **Lighting:** Cinematic volumetric god rays, depth-of-field bokeh lights, inner glows on elements.
- **Materials:** Translucent glass-like holograms, glowing edges, microchip traces visible inside objects.
- **Render Style:** Ultra-detailed 8K, high-end digital (e.g., Octane Render or Redshift) – sharp, vibrant, professional.

**Color Palette**

- **Dominant Glows:** **Electric Cyan / Blue** (#00FFFF variants) and **Neon/Lime Green** (#39FF14). THESE ARE THE PRIMARY BRAND COLORS.
- **Accents:** Use purple ONLY sparingly for very deep shadows or minor contrast. **Avoid pinks/magentas.**
- **Base:** Dark background (#000000 to #0A0A1F) to make the Green and Blue pop.
- **Text/Overlays (if any):** Clean white sans-serif (e.g., Salesforce Sans or futuristic equivalent) with subtle cyan glow.

**Key Elements & Compositions**

- **Central Focus:** Often a holographic Salesforce cloud logo, neural network core, dashboard interface, or agent nodes.
- **Icons/Symbols:** Gears (optimization), lightbulb (advisory), neural nodes/AI brains, shields (security), upward graphs (performance), data streams.
- **Dynamics:** Flowing green/blue data streams, pulsating energy, holographic projections floating in space.
- **Framing:** Rectangular cards with rounded corners and neon borders (AppExchange-style) for service pages; full-bleed for hero images.
